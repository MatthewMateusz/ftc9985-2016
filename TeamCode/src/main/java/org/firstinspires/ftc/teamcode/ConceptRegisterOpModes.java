/**
 * This class demonstrates how to manually register opmodes.
 *
 * Note: It is NOT required to manually register OpModes, but this method is provided to support teams that
 * want to have centralized control over their opmode lists.
 * This sample is ALSO handy to use to selectively register the other sample opmodes.
 * Just copy/paste this sample to the TeamCode module and then uncomment the opmodes you wish to run.
 *
 * How it works:
 * The registerMyOpmodes method will be called by the system during the automatic registration process
 * You can register any of the opmodes in your App. by making manager.register() calls inside registerMyOpmodes();
 *
 * Note:
 * Even though you are performing a manual Registration, you should set the Annotations on your classes so they
 * can be placed into the correct Driver Station OpMode list...  eg:
 *
 * @Autonomous(name="DriveAndScoreRed", group ="Red")
 * or
 * @TeleOp(name="FastDrive", group ="A-Team")
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Then uncomment and copy the manager.register() call to register as many of your OpModes as you like.
 * You can even use it to temporarily register samples directly from the robotController/external/samples folder.
